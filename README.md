# Inferential-Statistical-Analysis-of-Diabetes-Data

Introduction:

Inferential statistics and hypothesis testing is still used extensively in biomedical 
engineering  and  its  subfields,  as  it  helps  explain  observed  phenomena  instead  of  simply 
summarizing it as with descriptive statistics. In particular, in diagnostics, scientists can learn what 
signs accompany or indicate a given disease. In this dataset, anonymized medical data for a number 
of people with and without diabetes are provided and we will analyze if differences in these features 
between the two groups is statistically significant (i.e., if it could be used for diagnosis of type 2 
diabetes).  In  order  to  reduce  the  need  for  standardization  of  background,  all  participants  here 
identify as female, are at least 21 years old, and identify as being of Pima Indian heritage.
